To fix this, ensure the parent container has an explicitly defined width (e.g., using `width: 500px;` or a percentage based on its parent). Alternatively, use a different approach to achieve the desired layout, perhaps avoiding `calc()` or using a different CSS property altogether. In the solution, we've added a width to the parent container to ensure that the `calc()` function works as expected.
